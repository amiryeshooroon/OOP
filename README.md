# OOP

First lesson:

I have updated the directory named "1" with the code from the first lesson. I have also seperated the code to `.cpp` 
and `.h` files as I said.

The file named `main.cpp` contains a little test for the desired functionality, except the delete party member 
function which I did not implement due to time constraints. 

If you have any problems understanding the code or implementing something, please let me know.

Second Lesson:

I have uploaded the files from the seocnd lesson to the directory called "2". The notebook with my scraches is also available there (the name of the file is `Sadna 2.pdf`).
