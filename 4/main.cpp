  Create a linked list (with prev and next), supporting:
    * GetHead - returns a pointer to the head of the list.
    * Size - returns the number of elements in the list.
    * Two versions of insert function - One receives only the data to insert (and inserts the element as the head of the list). The other one will also receive a pointer - and insert the new element AFTER the given pointer.
    * Remove function - receives a pointer and deletes it from the list.
    * DTOR - when destroying the list, all of the elements should be deleted as well.
